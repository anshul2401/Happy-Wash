  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  fonts:
    - family: Lato
      fonts:
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Lato-Bold.ttf

        - asset: assets/fonts/Alegreya-Regular.ttf
        - asset: assets/fonts/Alegreya-Bold.ttf
          weight: 700
    # - family: Schyler
    #   fonts:
    #     - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
